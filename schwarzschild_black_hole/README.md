# schwarzschild black hole renderer

This is a gpu-based rendering program written in processing (java) and glsl. ofcourse, to run them you need [processing](https://processing.org/download) installed. 

To run the program just load the code into processing software and press 'run'  :D
> It may take some time to render, and during that time your system may become unresponsive. This is perfectly normal, just be patient and wait for the render to finish. **Higher resolutions take more time, so be careful with the resolution setting.** 

to understand why i did this and what all those settings mean, watch this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/B2_OHkKjX3c).
