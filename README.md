# schwarzschild blackhole renderer

a primitive schwarzschild blackhole renderer coded in python. there are no accretion disks in this version.

to run this you must have `numpy`, `scipy` and `pillow` installed.

edit `RESOLUTION`, `BLACK_HOLE_POSITION`, `FOV` and `dphi` (lines 12-18) to your liking to get results that you like.

to understand why I did this, and what each line means, see this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/B2_OHkKjX3c)
